          Due to a problem that many full stack engineering teams face today - a
          lack of enthusiastic frontend engineers - I joined one of their agile
          teams as a dedicated frontend developer and quickly became a valuable
          resource for their more junior engineers, then later a key voice when
          making decisions regarding new feature implementation and application
          architecture.

          My most significant contribution to Bruin was participating in the
          final six months of development on and seeing the launch and
          deployment of a \"create a new product\" feature that took nearly two
          years to complete. However, the most enjoyable and rewarding memories
          were easily the pair-coding and collaboration sessions with other
          developers.

          When MetTel began to prioritize some of its tech debt I was tapped to
          work directly with Martin Volerich (formerly Bloomberg, Meta), the new
          principal frontend engineer.

          After some deliberation, we chose to take a modular (conceptually
          similar to a micro-frontend) approach. This allowed us to begin
          refactoring our "Foundation" components into a coherent design system
          one by one, and gave Bruin engineers the ability begin importing and
          using the new components immediately from the npm registry.

          Additionally, working in a fresh repository made it possible for us to
          move away from the headaches of a 'create-react-app' application that
          was ejected many years ago, as well as eliminate any reliance on
          webpack by moving to Vite for our bundler.
          <NewParagraph />
          Proper use of Typescript was essential to improving code standards and
          developer experience. Other technology choices included some of my
          favorite libraries from Tanner Linsley's Tanstack (react-query,
          react-table, react-virtual) and Jotai for simple, lightweight, and
          sane state management compared to Bruin's heavy reliance on Redux.

          Lastly, as important as it was to modernize both Bruin itself and the
          experience of the developers working on it, we agreed that it was
          equally - if not more- important to take the opportunity to set a new
          standard for testing that included unit tests (vitest) and robust
          visual examples (Storybook). To accomplish this, we took a "Test
          Driven Development" (TDD) approach from day one.
