          years to complete. However, the most enjoyable and rewarding memories

          design system one by one, and gave Bruin engineers the ability begin
          importing and using the new components immediately from the npm

          Proper use of Typescript was essential to improving code standards and

          react-table, react-virtual) and Jotai for simple, lightweight, and
          sane state management compared to Bruin's heavy reliance on Redux.

          Lastly, as important as it was to modernize both Bruin itself and the
          experience of the developers working on it, we agreed that it was
          equally - if not more- important to take the opportunity to set a new
          standard for testing that included unit tests (vitest) and robust
          visual examples (Storybook). To accomplish this, we took a "Test
          Driven Development" (TDD) approach from day one.
