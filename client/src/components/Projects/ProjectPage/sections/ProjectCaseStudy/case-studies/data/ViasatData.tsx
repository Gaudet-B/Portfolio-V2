          Security Engineering team, which led those engineers to architect new
          development environments that would soon be adopted company-wide.
          These "boxes" lived on EC2 instances, could be spun up fairly quickly,

          front-to-back, while still maintaining our principle of operating with
          startup-like speed.

          In the 18 months I spent working with the Viasat Security Engineering
          team, large numbers of new users were on-boarded after a fairly public
          acquisition. This challenged us to find a balance between scaling
          backend infrastructure and being responsive to user feedback with new
          features.

          Particularly, keeping application data synchronized was a challenge
          due to the automated nature of tracking compliance on these systems.
          Relevant data came from three separate sources, users were able to
          make some changes via the UI, and a Redis cache - along with some
          tricky optimistic updates - was used to ensure a completely seemless
          user experience with zero loading screens or spinners after initial
          load.
